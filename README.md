# PromptTester

Test and compare LLM prompts across OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini with real-time cost tracking.

## Features

- **Multi-Provider**: OpenAI (GPT-4/5), Claude (Opus/Sonnet), Gemini (Pro/Flash)
- **Batch Testing**: Run multiple scenarios simultaneously
- **Cost Tracking**: Real-time pricing with token usage
- **Comparison Mode**: Side-by-side response comparison
- **Import/Export**: Share scenarios as JSON

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

1. Add your API keys
2. Create test scenarios
3. Run and compare results

## How It Works

The app uses official SDKs to connect directly to each provider. It automatically handles role conversion between different APIs (e.g., OpenAI's "developer" â†’ Claude's "user") and calculates costs based on each provider's pricing structure.
